# Project Sunflower :sunflower: : a sun tracking solar panel 
The repo for our Microprocessors Project 

The final branch is Final_Project (default)

Included are the files to implement a sun tracking solar panel
This includes a python file which is used along with UART and pyserial to capture the data from our LDRs, solar panels (and other goodies) in real time

Original branch was Simple_Interupt v5.4 hence the inclusion of old, legacy files e.g DAC_Interupt (these can be excluded if so desired).
